# 🐛 YT-Downloader v1.2.0 - The "Polish" Update

Small fixes based on your feedback!

## 🔧 Changes
- **Console Log Size:** Fixed an issue where the console log was taking up too much screen space. It is now much more compact.
- **Visuals:** Minor layout adjustments.

## ✨ New Features (Phase 2)

### 🖼️ Video Thumbnail Preview
- The app now fetches and displays the **video thumbnail** instantly when you paste a link.
- Visual confirmation of what you are about to download.

### 📄 File Name Preview
- Added a new **"File:"** label that shows you the *exact* filename (e.g., `MyVideo.mp4`).
- Updates dynamically when you switch between **Video** and **Audio** modes.

### 🧠 Smart Status Messages
- No more guessing! The status bar now tells you exactly what's happening:
  - 🟠 **"Processing / Converting..."**
  - 🟠 **"Merging Video/Audio..."**
  - 🟢 **"Finalizing..."**

### 🛠️ Improvements
- Smoother UI transitions when loading video info.
- Better filename sanitization logic.

### 💾 Persistence & Settings
- **Custom Download Folder:** Choose exactly where you want your files to go.
- **Auto-Save Settings:** The app now remembers your:
  - Download Folder
  - Cookie Settings (Browser or File)
- **Config Reliability:** Settings are now safely stored in your AppData folder (`%APPDATA%/YT-Downloader`), so they survive updates.

### 🛠️ Fixes & Improvements
- Fixed issue where settings weren't saving.
- Improved error handling for "Cookies Database Locked" errors.
- Added "Clear Log" button.
- Cleaned up the project structure.
